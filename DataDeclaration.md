## Option 1: Describe the nature of data you would like to use and where such data could come from in 2-3 sentences.

I'd like to use the 5GB "OathKeepers" data breach, from https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Oath_Keepers, provided I am permitted access as a researcher. These are chatlogs and other information exfiltrated from a domestic terrorist organization operating in the United States. It would be interesting to perform statistical analysis on the distribution of words, sentiment analyses, passwords, etc. and how it differs to "baseline" datasets.

Most of this is available via download, with extra requiring request for access.
