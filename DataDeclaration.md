## Option 1: Describe the nature of data you would like to use and where such data could come from in 2-3 sentences.

I'd like to use the 5GB "OathKeepers" data breach, from https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Oath_Keepers, provided I am permitted access as a researcher. These are chatlogs and other information exfiltrated from a domestic terrorist organization operating in the United States. It would be interesting to perform statistical analysis on the distribution of words, sentiment analyses, passwords, etc. and how it differs to "baseline" datasets.

Most of this is available via download, with extra requiring request for access.


## Option 2:  Describe the nature of data you would like to use and where such data could come from in 2-3 sentences.

The [MusicNet dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/imsparsh/musicnet-dataset) is a 23GB dataset of classical music that can be downloaded from Kaggle, containing labels for instrument, composer, note-onset times, and musical notes.

This is plenty interesting for analysis (e.g. fuzzy hashing for popular sounds), for exploration (finding music by different properties, or exploring a learned "latent space"), or for generation (e.g. by any of the various DNN methods available, or by classical methods). 

In some cases, I might use a "pared down" version of the data, to make it more usable for a web-app that I host on my own laptop.
