# Introduction

1 page.

What is your project about? What are you trying to communicate by publishing your Dashboard? What data analytics visualization are you offering?

---

# Dataset Description 

0.5 pages.

What are the specifics of data sets you are using? What real world (public/private) data or artificial (fake) data are you using? What are the reasons you choose them?

---

# System Functionality

1.5 pages.

What specific data visualization does your website offer? In writing, make references to figures with proper numbers that you will include in Section 4. In your writing, make sure you include what “data analytics” your Dashboard addresses with plots/graphs? You are not showing the graphs and plots for the sake of pretty figures. What are the analytic (computation) goals behind the figures?

# Screenshot Attachment

7 pages max.

You can include multiple pages of screenshots as needed up to 7 pages. Each screenshot should have a figure number (e.g., Figure 1, Figure 2, etc.) and each should have a short annotation explaining what the plot/graph is about (i.e., Figure caption). The figure numbers should be referred to in the body of the paper as needed.
